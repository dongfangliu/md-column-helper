## README.md

> ###### This is a small c++ project which aims at helping build tables in markdown format in a visual and handy way.

### Environment

 Linux or Mac

### How to use 

Under the project location  
    
    $ make

This will create a md_col_builder executable 

Please add the executable permission

    $ chmod +x md_col_builder executable
    
Now you can use it without arguments.
And this is the only way to use it.

    $ ./md_col_builder
    
I provided a SampleInput and Sample output.
    
Hope it to be helpful!

If you want it to output into a file,  
Please use " -o filename " as follows:
    
    $ ./md_col_builder -o myout

###### That's All. Thx!
